<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Background</h2>
<p><em>In this experiment we develop a Machine Learning model using XGBoost that can evaluate two neighboring schedules and rank them according to preference. This ranking model can be applied to quickly guide the search process towards a ‘good enough’ solution.</em></p>
<p><em>The choice of using an ordinal model instead of a cardinal model is based on the consideration that it is significantly easier to determine whether alternative A is superior to B than to quantify the exact difference between A and B. This makes intuitive sense when considering the scenario of holding two identical-looking packages and deciding which one is heavier, as opposed to estimating the precise weight difference between them. <span class="citation" data-cites="ho_ordinal_2000">(<a href="#ref-ho_ordinal_2000" role="doc-biblioref">Ho et al. 2000</a>)</span>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: <em>To evaluate the performance of the XGBoost ranking model, we will use Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation with 5 splits, ensuring each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Using StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=94), the dataset will be divided into five folds. In each iteration, the model will be trained on four folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. A custom callback, CustomCallback(period=10), will print the evaluation log every 10 epochs.</em></p>
<p><em>The fit_and_score function will fit the model and score it on both the training and test sets, storing the results for each fold. This provides insight into the model’s performance across different subsets of the data, helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data and identifies potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The overall processing time for the cross-validation will also be recorded.</em></p>

<p><em>Calculating the ambiguousness of the predicted probabilities helps in understanding the model’s confidence in its predictions. High ambiguousness indicates uncertain predictions, while low ambiguousness indicates confident predictions.</em></p>
<p><em>Ambiguousness is calculated using the formula for entropy:</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H(X) = - \sum_{i} p(x_i) \log_b p(x_i)
\]</span></p>
<p><em>Where in our case:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H(X)\)</span> <em>is the ambiguousness of the random variable</em> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <em>- the set of probability scores for the predicted rankings,</em></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(x_i)\)</span> <em>is probability score</em> <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span><em>,</em></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\log_b\)</span> <em>is the logarithm with base</em> <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> <em>(here</em> <span class="math inline">\(\log_2\)</span> <em>as we have two predicted values),</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The sum is taken over all possible outcomes of</em> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span><em>.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Calculating cumulative error rate and cumulative accuracy helps in understanding how the model’s performance evolves over the dataset.</em></p>
<p><em>Visualizing the relationship between ambiguousness and error provides insights into how uncertainty in the model’s predictions correlates with its accuracy. This can help in identifying patterns and understanding the conditions under which the model performs well or poorly.</em></p>

<p><em>In the initial model the choice of hyperparameters was based on default values, examples from demo’s or trial and error. To improve the model’s performance, we applied a <a href="https://optuna.org/" target="_blank">hyperparameter optimization technique</a> to find the best set of hyperparameters. We used a grid search with cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost model. The grid search was performed over a predefined set of hyperparameters, and the best hyperparameters were selected based on the model’s performance on the validation set. The best hyperparameters were then used to train the final model.</em></p>

<p><em>We wanted to test whether an XGBoost classification model could be used to assess and rank the quality of pairs of schedules. For performance benchmarking we use the conventional calculation method utilizing Lindley recursions.</em></p>
<p><em>We trained the XGBoost ranking model with a limited set of features (schedules) and labels (objectives). The total number of possible schedules is approximately 52.0 million. For training and validation, we sampled 20000 schedules. Generating the feature and label set took a total of 18.7585 seconds, with the calculation of objective values accounting for 18.2701 seconds.</em></p>
<p><em>The model demonstrates strong and consistent performance with high accuracies both for training as well as testing, good generalization and stability. Total training time for the final model was 1.2767 seconds. The evaluation of 1000 test schedules took 0.0053 seconds for the the XGBoost model and 1.0287 for the conventional method, which is an improvement of 195X.</em></p>
