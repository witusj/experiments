<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Background</h2>
<p><em>To find optimal solutions for appointment scheduling problems one approach is to create local search neighborhoods and evaluate the schedules in that set. A better search method either (1) - creates smaller search neighborhoods or (2) - evaluates faster.</em></p>
<p><em>One approach for speeding up evaluation is to create surrogate models, or metamodels. These are simplified representations of complex systems that are often created using machine learning techniques.</em></p>
<p><em>In this experiment we develop a Machine Learning model using XGBoost that can evaluate two neighboring schedules and rank them according to preference. This ranking model can be applied to quickly guide the search process towards a `good enough’ solution.</em></p>
<p><em>The choice of using an ordinal model instead of a cardinal model is based on the following considerations <span class="citation" data-cites="ho_ordinal_2000">(<a href="#ref-ho_ordinal_2000" role="doc-biblioref">Ho et al. 2000</a>)</span>:</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Accuracy</strong>: <em>The convergence of ‘order’ occurs at an exponential rate, while ‘value’ converges at a rate of</em> <span class="math inline">\(1/t^{1/2}\)</span>. <em>In simpler terms, it is significantly easier to determine whether alternative A is superior to B than to quantify the exact difference between A and B. This makes intuitive sense when considering the scenario of holding two identical-looking packages and deciding which one is heavier, as opposed to estimating the precise weight difference between them.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: <em>When evaluating a complex system is computationally expensive, it’s more efficient to use a method that quickly identifies a subset of solutions with a high likelihood of containing the optimal or near-optimal solution. By focusing computational resources on refining the search within this promising subset, rather than across the entire solution space, we can significantly reduce the overall computational burden.</em></p></li>

<p><em>To compare an XGBoost Machine Learning model with a simple evaluation of each individual element of the pair, we will use a pairwise ranking approach. The objective is to rank two neighboring schedules according to preference.</em></p>
<p><em>We will create a random set of pairs of neighboring schedules with</em> <span class="math inline">\(N = 12\)</span> patients and <span class="math inline">\(\ T = 18\)</span> intervals of length <span class="math inline">\(d = 5\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>A neighborhood consists of all schedules that differ by one patient only. Eg: ([2,1,1], [1,1,2]) are neighbors and ([2,1,1], [1,0,3]) are not.</em></p>
<p><em>Service times will have a discrete distribution. The probability of a scheduled patient not showing up will be</em> <span class="math inline">\(q = 0.20\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>The objective function will be the weighted average of the total waiting time of all patients and overtime. The model will be trained to predict which of the two neighboring schedules has the lowest objective value. The prediction time will be recorded. Then the same schedules will be evaluated by computing the objective value and then ranked.</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: <em>To evaluate the performance of the XGBoost ranking model, we will use Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation with 5 splits, ensuring each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Using StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=94), the dataset will be divided into five folds. In each iteration, the model will be trained on four folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. A custom callback, CustomCallback(period=10), will print the evaluation log every 10 epochs.</em></p>
<p><em>The fit_and_score function will fit the model and score it on both the training and test sets, storing the results for each fold. This provides insight into the model’s performance across different subsets of the data, helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data and identifies potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The overall processing time for the cross-validation will also be recorded.</em></p>

<p><em>Calculating the ambiguousness of the predicted probabilities helps in understanding the model’s confidence in its predictions. High ambiguousness indicates uncertain predictions, while low ambiguousness indicates confident predictions.</em></p>
<p><em>Calculating cumulative error rate and cumulative accuracy helps in understanding how the model’s performance evolves over the dataset.</em></p>
<p><em>Visualizing the relationship between ambiguousness and error provides insights into how uncertainty in the model’s predictions correlates with its accuracy. This can help in identifying patterns and understanding the conditions under which the model performs well or poorly.</em></p>

<p><em>In the initial model the choice of hyperparameters was based on default values, examples from demo’s or trial and error. To improve the model’s performance, we applied a <a href="https://optuna.org/" target="_blank">hyperparameter optimization technique</a> to find the best set of hyperparameters. We used a grid search with cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost model. The grid search was performed over a predefined set of hyperparameters, and the best hyperparameters were selected based on the model’s performance on the validation set. The best hyperparameters were then used to train the final model.</em></p>

<p><em>We wanted to test whether an XGBoost classification model could be used to assess and rank the quality of pairs of schedules. For performance benchmarking we use the conventional calculation method utilizing Lindley recursions.</em></p>
<p><em>We trained the XGBoost ranking model with a limited set of features (schedules) and labels (objectives). The total number of possible schedules is approximately 52.0 million. For training and validation, we sampled 20000 schedules. Generating the feature and label set took a total of 22.3734 seconds, with the calculation of objective values accounting for 22.0417 seconds.</em></p>
<p><em>The model demonstrates strong and consistent performance with high accuracies both for training as well as testing, good generalization and stability. Total training time for the final model was 0.3281 seconds. The evaluation of 1000 test schedules took 0.0045 seconds for the the XGBoost model and 0.8739 for the conventional method, which is an improvement of 196X.</em></p>
