<p><strong>Background Information</strong>: <em>To find optimal solutions for appointment scheduling problems one approach is to create local search neighborhoods and evaluate each schedule. A better search method either (1) - creates smaller search neighborhoods or (2) - evaluates faster. In this experiment we develop an Machine Learning model using XGBoost that can evaluate two neighboring schedules and rank them according to preference.</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: <em>To evaluate the performance of the XGBoost model, we will use Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation with 5 splits, ensuring each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Using StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=94), the dataset will be divided into five folds. In each iteration, the model will be trained on four folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. A custom callback, CustomCallback(period=10), will print the evaluation log every 10 epochs. The fit_and_score function will fit the model and score it on both the training and test sets, storing the results for each fold. This provides insight into the model’s performance across different subsets of the data. The overall processing time for the cross-validation will also be recorded.</em></p>
