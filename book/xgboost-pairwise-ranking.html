<p><strong>Design</strong>: <em>To compare an XGBoost Machine Learning model with a simple evaluation of each individual element of the pair, we will use a pairwise ranking approach. The objective is to rank two neighboring schedules according to preference.</em></p>
<p><em>We will create a random set of pairs of neighboring schedules with</em> <span class="math inline">\(N = 12\)</span> patients and <span class="math inline">\(\ T = 18\)</span> intervals of length <span class="math inline">\(d = 5\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>A neighborhood consists of all schedules that differ by one patient only. Eg: ([2,1,1], [1,1,2]) are neighbors and ([2,1,1], [1,0,3]) are not.</em></p>
<p><em>Service times will have a discrete distribution. The probability of a scheduled patient not showing up will be</em> <span class="math inline">\(q = 0.20\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>The objective function will be the total waiting time of all patients. The model will be trained to predict which of the two neighboring schedules has the lowest objective value. The prediction time will be recorded. Then the same schedules will be evaluated by computing the objective value and then ranked.</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: <em>To evaluate the performance of the XGBoost ranking model, we will use Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation with 5 splits, ensuring each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Using StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=94), the dataset will be divided into five folds. In each iteration, the model will be trained on four folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. A custom callback, CustomCallback(period=10), will print the evaluation log every 10 epochs.</em></p>
<p><em>The fit_and_score function will fit the model and score it on both the training and test sets, storing the results for each fold. This provides insight into the model’s performance across different subsets of the data, helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data and identifies potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The overall processing time for the cross-validation will also be recorded.</em></p>

<p><em>Calculating the ambiguousness of the predicted probabilities helps in understanding the model’s confidence in its predictions. High ambiguousness indicates uncertain predictions, while low ambiguousness indicates confident predictions.</em></p>
<p><em>Calculating cumulative error rate and cumulative accuracy helps in understanding how the model’s performance evolves over the dataset.</em></p>
<p><em>Visualizing the relationship between ambiguousness and error provides insights into how uncertainty in the model’s predictions correlates with its accuracy. This can help in identifying patterns and understanding the conditions under which the model performs well or poorly.</em></p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: <em>We wanted to test whether an XGBoost classification model could be used to assess and rank the quality of pairs of schedules. For performance benchmarking we use the conventional calculation method using Lindley recursions.</em></p>
<p><em>We trained the XGBoost ranking model using a limited set of features (schedules) and labels (objectives). The total number of possible schedules is approximately 52.0 million. For training and validation, we used a sample of 20000 schedules. Generating the feature and label set took a total of 8.5189 seconds, with the calculation of objective values accounting for 8.1933 seconds.</em></p>
<p><em>The model demonstrates strong and consistent performance with high accuracies both for training as well as testing, good generalization and stability. Total training time for the final model was 0.3492 seconds. The evaluation of 1000 test schedules took 0.0047 seconds for the the XGBoost model and 0.4199 for the conventional method, which is an improvement of 89X.</em></p>
